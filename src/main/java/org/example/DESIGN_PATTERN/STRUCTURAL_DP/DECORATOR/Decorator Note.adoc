A real-life example of the Decorator design pattern can be seen in a coffee shop where customers can order various types of coffee with different toppings or flavors.

In this example, the base component is the "Coffee" interface, which represents the common functionality of all types of coffee.

```java
public interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double getCost();
}
```

The concrete component is the actual coffee implementation, such as "Espresso" or "Latte."

```java
public class Espresso implements Coffee {
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Espresso";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return 1.99;
    }
}
```

Now, let's say customers can add additional flavors or toppings to their coffee. We can use decorators to dynamically add these extras to the coffee.

```java
public abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee coffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription();
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost();
    }
}
```

Here's an example of a concrete decorator, representing an additional flavor like "Vanilla."

```java
public class VanillaDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public VanillaDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Vanilla";
    }

    @Override
    public double getCost() {
        return super.getCost() + 0.50;
    }
}
```

In the client code, customers can order different combinations of coffee and decorators.

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Order a plain espresso
        Coffee espresso = new Espresso();
        System.out.println("Order: " + espresso.getDescription());
        System.out.println("Cost: $" + espresso.getCost());

        // Order a latte with vanilla flavor
        Coffee latte = new Latte();
        latte = new VanillaDecorator(latte);
        System.out.println("Order: " + latte.getDescription());
        System.out.println("Cost: $" + latte.getCost());
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Coffee` interface defines the methods `getDescription()` and `getCost()` for retrieving the description and cost of a coffee.

The `Espresso` class implements the `Coffee` interface and represents a concrete coffee type.

The `CoffeeDecorator` class is the abstract decorator that extends the `Coffee` interface. It has a reference to the decorated coffee object and provides default implementations for the `getDescription()` and `getCost()` methods by delegating the calls to the decorated object.

The `VanillaDecorator` class is a concrete decorator that extends the `CoffeeDecorator`. It adds the behavior of vanilla flavor to the coffee by modifying the `getDescription()` and `getCost()` methods.

In the client code, an espresso is ordered and displayed. Then, a latte is ordered and decorated with the `VanillaDecorator`, resulting in a coffee with vanilla flavor.

The Decorator pattern allows us to add new features or behaviors to objects dynamically at runtime, without modifying their underlying structure. It provides a flexible and reusable way to extend the functionality of objects in a transparent manner.
